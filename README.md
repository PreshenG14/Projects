C Coding Projects

Project 1 - 21355491 P Govender (1).txt

Develop code to run in IDE simulation mode that turns pins 0-7 of Port A ON/OFF using a waveform of duty cycle equal to 20% and change the period after each cycle. The waveform should be displayed in the logic analyzer window

Stage 1 – 500 cycles
Stage 2 – 1000 cycles
Stage 3 – 100 cycles
Stage 4 – 200 cycles

Project 2 - 21355491 P Govender P2.c

Write an interrupt driven program that uses Timer1 on the PIC24FJ128GA microcontroller to create a clock signal. Use a main function to count the clock ticks into a 16-bit variable. As visual feedback, map the lower 8 bits of the clock-tick-count variable to the lower 8 bits of PORT A and show this using the Logic Analyzer window.

Project 3 - 21355491 Prac 3.c

A temperature controlled chamber is heated from -20 °C until 120 °C at a rate of 10 °C every 2000 simulation clock periods. Write C code that emulates the output of the Microchip TC1047A temperature-sensing device using Figure 10-3 on page 150 of the text. Next map the analog voltage value to a 10-bit digital word value using a uniform mapping of the range 0 to 3.3 V to the corresponding 10-bit range of 0 to 1024. Finally write the digital value to PORT B at the rate of one value each 2000 clock periods. Show the output on the logic analyzer window.
