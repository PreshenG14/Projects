C test Coding Projects

Write a program that implements the following:
Use pointers to fill a 15-element array with the voltage values corresponding to temperature values in
the range -20 째C to 120 째C inclusive in steps of 10 degrees Celsius
Use pointers to fill a second 15-element array with the voltage error values if the voltage error value for
each voltage value is 5 % of the respective voltage value.
Compute the root-mean-square (rms) value of the error voltage values. Note this is a single value and not
an array.
Show the numerical value of the root-mean-square value of the error voltage values.
Use pointers to fill a third 15-element array with the revised voltage values corresponding to temperature
values in the range -20 째C to 120 째C inclusive in steps of 10 degrees Celsius based on the following: the
associated error voltage value in the second array is subtracted from the respective voltage value in the
first array.
Show the numerical values of the third array.
