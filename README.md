Python Coding Projects

The aim of the project is to is to produce a robot that can drive autonomously in the correct environment. The robot will not rely on human inputs to carry out its driving, thus eliminating accidents in the industry. The robot will require a ‘brain’ to process the correct movements and complete the relevant checks before it can allow any movements.

The robot will have sensors at the front in order to drive autonomously. These sensors will have to detect a light-coloured surface from a dark path as well as know how far away from the path it is. The further away the robot from the line, tighter and quicker turns are needed to put the robot back on its path. Infrared sensors can be used for this application. The transmitter sends an infrared signal, which can be received by the receiver. However, signals are easily reflected by light-coloured surfaces whereas on dark-coloured the signal is absorbed therefore not received by the receiver. This is how the sensors can tell the difference between light and dark.  

The robot will also have to aware of its surroundings to avoid any crashes as you would expect from an autonomous car. The is necessary in the real world as when we consider road safety, pedestrians are the number one priority. The robot will have to know how far it is from an obstacle before it moves in any direction. The robot will also have to send all the data wirelessly to a mobile app.
